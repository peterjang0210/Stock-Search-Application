# Stock-Search-Application

## Overview

This website takes advantage of the [iexTrading API](https://iextrading.com) to display information about various stocks. When the user clicks on the button that contains the stock that they wish to learn more about, the webpage displays the company name, logo, latest price, and upto 10 recent news articles about the stock. There is also a functionality to access different stocks than the ones preset on the page. When the user enters a valid stock symbol into the input field, a new button containing that stock symbol is created. This new button displays the same info as the preset buttons when pressed. If an invalid stock symbol is entered into the input field, the user receives an alert requesting that they enter a valid stock symbol. The user can also clear the information displayed by pressing the clear button.
